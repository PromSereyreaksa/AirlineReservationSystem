# Access Control in Airline Reservation System

## Introduction
Access control is a critical aspect of any software system, including an airline reservation system. It ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions within the system, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining system integrity.

## Types of Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC assigns permissions to users based on their roles within the organization. For example:
- **Admin**: Can manage all aspects of the system, including user accounts and flight schedules.
- **Agent**: Can book, modify, and cancel reservations for customers.
- **Customer**: Can view flight schedules and manage their own reservations.

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
ABAC uses attributes (such as user role, time of access, and resource type) to determine access permissions. This provides more fine-grained control compared to RBAC.

## Static Access Control
Static access control refers to permissions that are defined and enforced at compile-time or configuration-time. These permissions do not change dynamically during runtime. Examples include:
- Hardcoded role permissions in the application code.
- Configuration files that specify access rules.

## Implementing Access Control

### Using Middleware
Middleware can be used to enforce access control rules before requests reach the main application logic. For example, in a Node.js application, you can use middleware to check user roles and permissions.

### Using Annotations
In some frameworks, annotations can be used to specify access control rules directly in the code. For example, in a Java Spring application, you can use `@PreAuthorize` annotations to enforce access control.

## Conclusion
Implementing robust access control mechanisms is essential for the security and integrity of an airline reservation system. By using a combination of RBAC, ABAC, and static access control, you can ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive operations and data.
